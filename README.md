PolyMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

This is a **fork** of the MultiMC Launcher and not endorsed by MultiMC. The PolyMC community felt that the maintainer was not acting in the spirit of Free Software so this fork was made.

# Help & Support

Feel free to create an issue if you need help. However, you might find it easier to ask in the Discord server.

## Building

If you want to build PolyMC yourself, check [Build Instructions](https://polymc.org/wiki/development/build-instructions/) for build instructions.

## Code formatting

Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:

- Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
- Prefer readability over dogma.
- Keep to the existing formatting.
- Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
- Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.

## Translations
